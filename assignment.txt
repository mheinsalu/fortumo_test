Task for Software Engineer applicant

Test task
Create a simple web server that can sum up numbers in a multi-threaded environment.
• Create a Java HTTP server application that accepts at least 20 simultaneous requests. You can use Jetty
or Tomcat web servers as the engine. Arriving requests will be HTTP POST requests.
• If a request with a number arrives, keep the number around, do not respond yet.
• If a request with the keyword "end" (without the quotes) arrives then respond with the sum of all
received numbers to all open requests (e.g. if you request with numbers 4 and 7 and end, all three
requests should get response 11).
• Requests can arrive in parallel at the same time, the system must not lose any numbers or requests.
• Expected numbers are without decimal places and the sum of them will not exceed 10 billion (109
).
• After doing the "end" calculation forget all the numbers and be ready for the repeat cycle of operation
(getting new requests with new numbers, giving out a response on the next end).
• Provide the application to us as a source with the build and deploy instructions (preferably it should
build into a war file that can be run with Jetty or Tomcat).
• Provide tests as well

Example of operation
Terminal 1:
$ curl -d 1 http://localhost:1337/
6
## output "6" here is delayed until terminal 4 executes its request
Terminal 2:
$ curl -d 2 http://localhost:1337/
6
## output "6" here is delayed until terminal 4 executes its request
Terminal 3:
$ curl -d 3 http://localhost:1337/
6
## output "6" here is delayed until terminal 4 executes its request
Terminal 4:
$ curl -d end http://localhost:1337/
6
## output here is instant

Good luck!
